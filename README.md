# Expense Tracker

## Manage money responsibly

### Abstract

In order to start saving money, we have to understand where our income is being spent.
This expense tracker app will help to understand how the money is being spent, so we can make changes in 
spending habits and stay on top of finances. It aims to assist user in reducing their expenses and put more
money towards savings and emergency funds, and improve financial security. This application can be of use to
anyone who wants to have control of their money.

I wanted to create this app because I have always wanted to understand my spending habits and have been using
spreadsheets to simulate a budget app. This app will help me automate most of the basic budgeting and also provide an appealing user interface
to make budgeting easier.
